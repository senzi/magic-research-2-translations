    "\"*Are we sure* we're going the right way...?\"\n  \nYour hired wizard asks the question as you enter a fork in the road, with a doubtful expression on her face and her own weapon drawn. The place is crawling with dangerous enemies. You know the Philosopher's Stone has to be somewhere here - but... *where*?\n\n\"H-Hold on - let me focus...\" The Headmaster is the one who answers her, closing his eyes. For half a minute, your wizard companion and you stay still and silent.": "\"*我们确定*我们走对路了吗...？\"\n  \n你雇佣的巫师在你进入一个岔路口时问道，脸上带着怀疑的表情，手里还拿着自己的武器。这个地方到处都是危险的敌人。你知道哲人之石一定在这里的某个地方——但是...*在哪里*呢？\n\n\"等-等等——让我集中精神...\" 校长是回答她的人，他闭上了眼睛。半分钟的时间里，你和你的巫师同伴静静地站着，一言不发。",
    "\"*Of course they wouldn't let us in!* This place is so famous, they must be swarming with prospective students and all kinds of nosy people.\" Your hired wizard doesn't seem surprised.\n  \nBut you feel something is odd. For a place this famous, it surely looks... *deserted*. There is nobody in sight.": "\"*当然他们不会让我们进去！* 这个地方太有名了，肯定挤满了未来的学生和各种好奇的人。\" 你雇佣的巫师似乎并不感到惊讶。\n  \n但你感觉有些不对劲。对于这样一个有名的地方，它看起来确实...*荒废了*。视线范围内一个人也没有。",
    "\"*Satell*... is the Divine that you are looking for. And... he is not following our code. Our rules. Our policy of non-intervention in our Worlds, except in specific circumstances.\"\n  \nWhat are they talking about? Rules? Non-intervention?": "\"*Satell*...是你在寻找的神。而且...他没有遵循我们的准则。我们的规则。我们除了在特定情况下不干预我们世界的政策。\"\n  \n他们在说什么？规则？不干预？",
    "\"A wanted poster? We get several of those, fairly often, at the guild\", she mentions. \"It looks like this one references a nefarious alchemist that seems to be running experiments somewhere in the town sewers. It appears the wells in some places in town have become poisoned, and the town suspects this alchemist.\"\n  \nThen something she says catches your attention: \"It says here that the experiments have something to do with creating a Philosopher's Stone...\" *Your blood freezes.* You ask her to repeat and confirm the fact. She is not lying to you: that is what it says on the paper.": "\"通缉海报？我们在公会经常收到一些这样的东西\", 她提到。\"看起来这张海报提到的是一个邪恶的炼金术士，似乎在镇上的下水道里进行实验。镇上一些地方的井水似乎被毒化了，镇上怀疑是这个炼金术士干的。\"\n  \n然后她说的某件事引起了你的注意：\"这里说实验与创造哲人之石有关...\" *你的血液凝固了。* 你让她重复并确认这个事实。她没有对你撒谎：纸上就是这么写的。",
    "\"A-a v-visitor...?\"\n    \nYou hear a voice from above the main door. There is a window there.

    "\"After that... I-I forgot all about it, until one day, not t-too long ago, they approached me... and they said that they would renounce their position as Headmaster, and that I-I was to be their successor... and so it happened, as they left on an endeavour to 'create a new World' or so,\" he continues.\n    \n\"And as part of the first duties I did as a H-Headmaster... I did a full inventory of the School's treasury... and to do so, of course, I undid the lock on the Philosopher's Stone, to make sure it was still there.\" He looks down, with a somber expression.\n\n\"Of course, that was a b-big mistake. The l-lock was not just meant to *keep people away* from the Stone, but also to *conceal its location*. A-And when I undid it... t-that effect was lost...\"": "\"之后...我-我完全忘记了这件事，直到有一天，不久之前，他们找到我...他们说他们将放弃校长的职位，而我-我将成为他们的继任者...就这样，他们离开了，去进行一项'创造新世界'的尝试，\"他继续说道。\n    \n\"作为我作为校长的第一项职责...我对学校的金库进行了全面的盘点...当然，为了做到这一点，我解开了贤者之石的锁，以确保它还在那里。\"他低下头，表情忧郁。\n\n\"当然，那是一个大-大错误。那锁不仅仅是为了*让人们远离*贤者之石，也是为了*隐藏它的位置*。而-当我解开它时...那个效果就消失了...\"",
    "\"Ah, I see it's caught your eye,\" exclaims the merchant. \"This was written by a celebrity professor of a school of magic. It describes a way to *record* Essence Catalysts somehow, so that they can be used even when they are no longer there... how is that even possible, I wouldn't know, I'm not a wizard,\" he says.\n      \nYou are intrigued. That could be so useful - how much easier would it have been to set up your home if that was possible?! Until he says: \"Very useful, isn't it? It can be yours for *500K:coins:*. And not a single one less!\"\n\nThat's... a lot of :coins:, and you did already set up your Essence Catalysts, after all. You think again about whether it's worth buying the book...": "\"啊，我看它引起了你的注意，\"商人惊呼道。\"这是一位魔法学校的明星教授写的。它描述了一种*记录*精华催化剂的方法，这样即使它们不在那里，也可以使用...这是怎么可能的，我不知道，我不是巫师，\"他说。\n      \n你被吸引了。那可能非常有用 - 如果那可能的话，设置你的家会变得多么容易？！直到他说：\"非常有用，不是吗？它可以以*500K:coins:*的价格成为你的。而且一分钱也不能少！\"\n\n那是...很多:coins:，而且你已经设置了你的精华催化剂。你再次思考是否值得购买这本书...",
    "\"Although I cannot teach you anything else, there is one free service I can offer you: *damage measurement*\". The knight offers you a small piece of paper. You recognize the names of multiple spells, and attached to each of them is a number.\n      \n\"This is *how much damage you dealt with each attack* on your last fight\", he says. You look at the numbers again. You are a little dizzy trying to make sense out of it...": "\"虽然我不能教你其他东西，但我可以为你提供一项免费服务：*伤害测量*\"。骑士递给你一张小纸片。你认出了多个法术的名字，每个名字旁边都有一个数字。\n      \n\"这是你上次战斗中每次攻击造成的伤害量\"，他说。你再次看着这些数字。你有点头晕，试图理解它们...",
    "\"And let us also give you *a little extra*, as well.\" The Divine waves their arms. Your body is bathed in a warm light and you feel a unique power coursing through it.\n  \nYou have a good feeling about it. Somehow, it feels like you can harness a power you've never really *felt* before. Is it the power of Divinity...?": "\"让我们也给你*一点额外的东西*。\"神明挥动他们的手臂。你的身体被温暖的光芒包围，你感觉到一种独特的力量在其中流动。\n  \n你对此感觉很好。不知怎的，感觉你可以利用一种你从未真正*感受*过的力量。这是神明的力量吗...？",
    "\"And,\" he also exclaims, \"I'll cast spells under your lead. I-I'm still quite a novice Headmaster... and probably s-should have never been one... but... I know how to follow someone's lead and cast spells really, *really well*.\"\n\n**You have unlocked a new Exploration area: \"Aberrant Realm\"!**\n\n**The Magical Research card grants you a +50% bonus to Study for the rest of the run!**\n\n**And finally, the Headmaster's skillful spellcasting under someone's orders grants you the equivalent of 5 extra Wizards!**": "\"而且，\"他也惊呼道，\"我会在你的领导下施法。我-我还是一个相当新的校长...可能本-本不应该成为校长...但是...我知道如何跟随某人的领导并施法，真的，*真的很好*。\"\n\n**你已解锁新的探索区域：\"异常领域\"！**\n\n**魔法研究卡在本轮剩余时间内为你提供+50%的学习加成！**\n\n**最后，校长在某人命令下的熟练施法为你提供了相当于额外5个巫师的帮助！**",
    "\"As a special offer, I will join you entirely *for free*!\" As she says this, she decides to come inside your home. You are shocked - you didn't agree to anything yet! You are ready to kick her out. But before you reply, you pause and think about it some more. Having someone else helping you cast all those spells would certainly be a big help. Even more so if for free.\n    \nYou ask her to channel some Water, and then you notice her struggling. Beads of sweat start forming on her forehead as she tries to focus to show you her supposed skills. Eventually, she comes through, although she appears to be pretty exhausted. She surprisingly appears to be even less skilled than you are... *no wonder* the offer was actually free.": "\"作为特别优惠，我将完全*免费*加入你！\"当她这么说时，她决定进入你的家。你震惊了 - 你还没有同意任何事情！你准备把她赶出去。但在你回答之前，你停下来再想了想。有人帮你施放所有那些法术肯定会大有帮助。如果是免费的，那就更好了。\n    \n你让她引导一些水，然后你注意到她在挣扎。当她试图集中注意力向你展示她所谓的技能时，额头开始形成汗珠。最终，她成功了，尽管她看起来相当疲惫。她出人意料地看起来甚至比你还不熟练...*难怪*这个优惠实际上是免费的。",
    "\"As you can see... your World is but one of countless different ones. Each one... a different possibility, a different imagined reality - created by someone that is not bound to the constraints of a World... And someone sufficiently skilled with Magic can move between them at will.\"\n    \n\"This... is the *Truth of the World*.\" She says it solemnly.": "\"如你所见...你的世界只是无数不同世界中的一个。每一个...都是一个不同的可能性，一个不同的想象现实 - 由不受世界约束的人创造...而一个足够熟练的魔法师可以随意在它们之间移动。\"\n    \n\"这...就是*世界的真相*。\"她庄严地说。",
    "\"Automation\" Offering (Requires Ring of Mental Exertion +9)": "\"自动化\"提供（需要+9的精神劳累戒指）",
    "\"B-Before I even left the treasury, a portal appeared right inside, and an *army* of aberrant creatures started coming out of it! A-And I couldn't close the portal!\" You can feel his pain as he tells his story. Your wizard companion, too, appears worried.\n    \n\"S-So... of course, my priority instead had to switch - and I evacuated everyone else from the School and trapped those *creatures* in here,\" he says. \"I-I'm glad I was able to... but when I came back to the treasury, the Philospher's Stone was *gone*. N-No doubt taken by those creatures.\"": "\"在-在我离开金库之前，一个传送门出现在里面，一群*异常生物*开始从里面出来！而-而我无法关闭传送门！\"你可以感受到他讲述故事时的痛苦。你的巫师同伴也显得担忧。\n    \n\"所-所以...当然，我的优先事项不得不改变 - 我把其他所有人都从学校疏散了，并把那些*生物*困在了这里，\"他说。\"我-我很高兴我能够...但当我回到金库时，贤者之石*不见了*。毫-毫无疑问被那些生物拿走了。\"",
    "\"But you are too late. The procedures are complete. We are unstoppable now.\" She stands up, and turns to face you. Her hair, dark as obsidian, grouped in thick strands, waves behind her from magical power - and covers her visage, leaving only a faint smile.": "\"但你太迟了。程序已经完成。我们现在是不可阻挡的。\"她站起来，转身面对你。她的头发，黑如黑曜石，分成粗大的束，因魔法力量而波动 - 并遮住了她的面容，只留下一丝淡淡的微笑。",
    "\"But...\" He stops for a moment. For a second, you think he is going to steal the lamp, and you warn him. But he just laughs, loudly, and for nearly a minute.\n  \n\"No, I would never do that... it would be *completely useless* to me! Just as useless as it is to you!\"\n\nYou are not sure why he said that, but he explains shortly after: \"This artifact, the Boosting Lamp, does not work for just anyone. Whoever uses it must be someone that, *since they were children*, was raised next to and nurtured by it. No, none of us can use this now, and we won't be able to in our lives!\"": "\"但是...\"他停顿了一下。有那么一瞬间，你以为他要偷走那盏灯，于是你警告他。但他只是大声笑了，笑了将近一分钟。\n  \n\"不，我绝不会那么做...那对我来说*完全没用*！就像对你一样没用！\"\n\n你不确定他为什么这么说，但他随后解释道：\"这件神器，增强之灯，不是随便什么人都能用的。使用它的人必须是从小就在它旁边长大，由它滋养的人。不，我们现在没人能用它，这辈子都不可能！\"",
    "\"Congratulations on your victory\", she exclaims. \"You've certainly come a long way, haven't you?\"\n    \n\"Let me introduce myself\", she continues. \"I am the head instructor of combat - my name is Giselle. I am the one who extended you the invitation for this extra training course at these four Towers of Training. I don't think you have noticed me, but I saw you at the top of each of the Towers - and noticed your fights against the four guardians at the top. You did an excellent job.\" You thank her for the kind words.": "\"恭喜你取得胜利\"，她欢呼道。\"你确实走了很长的路，不是吗？\"\n    \n\"让我自我介绍一下\"，她继续说道。\"我是战斗的总教官——我的名字是吉赛尔。是我邀请你来参加这四座训练塔的额外训练课程的。我想你没有注意到我，但我在每座塔的顶部都看到了你——并注意到了你与塔顶四位守护者的战斗。你做得非常出色。\"你感谢她的赞美之词。",
    "\"Efficiency\" Offering (Requires Earth Lv45, 5M Earth Essence)": "\"效率\"献祭（需要土系等级45，500万土之精华）",
    "\"Go now. Be on your way.\" The Divine starts moving their wings, floating in the air, and then swiftly they fly away. You follow them with your eyes, but you lose them from sight in mere seconds.\n  \nYou look at the Divine Script. You knew how to make it, but getting the materials was... difficult. This will certainly come in handy.": "\"现在走吧。上路吧。\"神明开始挥动翅膀，漂浮在空中，然后迅速飞走了。你用目光追随他们，但仅仅几秒钟就看不见了。\n  \n你看着神圣卷轴。你知道如何制作它，但获取材料是...困难的。这肯定会派上用场。",
    "\"Halt! I mean you no harm\", she exclaims. \"I am just quite impressed by your command of Death and the sheer power of your /familiarName/.\"\n      \nShe asks you: \"You are... not actually a Zeth, are you?\"\n\nYou are not really quite sure how to answer...": "\"停下！我无意伤害你\"，她喊道。\"我只是对你掌握死亡的能力和你/熟悉名字/的强大力量印象深刻。\"\n      \n她问你：\"你...其实不是泽斯人，对吧？\"\n\n你不太确定该如何回答...",
    "\"Halt! You may *not* pass!\"\n      \nYou only manage to make a few steps towards the arch before you are interrupted. The voice came from a golden armor-clad elf. They seem much more powerful than those other elves that have been ambushing you, and they're holding a large magic staff.\n\nWith someone like that in the way, you are convinced they are protecting something valuable. But they look very strong... you contemplate what to do.": "\"停下！你*不能*通过！\"\n      \n你只向拱门走了几步就被打断了。声音来自一个身穿金色盔甲的精灵。他们看起来比那些一直在伏击你的其他精灵强大得多，而且他们手持一根大魔法杖。\n\n有这样的人挡路，你确信他们在保护什么有价值的东西。但他们看起来非常强大...你在考虑该怎么办。",
    "\"However\", he says, \"you will first need to show me that you can at least handle some basic combat. Let's have a short duel - *don't worry, I will not use my full strength* - and if you are able to win, I'll teach you some advanced combat techniques.\"\n    \nYou are now wary of him. He looks very strong. Is this really going to be possible?\n\n\"I will heal you before we begin, but otherwise, make sure you are ready for combat before we duel\", he finishes saying, before putting his helmet back on. You heed his words, and ready up for combat.": "\"不过\"，他说，\"你首先需要向我展示你至少能处理一些基本的战斗。让我们来一场短暂的决斗——*别担心，我不会用全力*——如果你能赢，我会教你一些高级的战斗技巧。\"\n    \n你现在对他保持警惕。他看起来非常强大。这真的可能吗？\n\n\"在我们开始之前我会治疗你，但除此之外，确保你在决斗前准备好战斗\"，他说完，重新戴上头盔。你听从他的话，准备战斗。",
    "\"I didn't manage to tell you, but... these portals really fascinate me\", she continues. \"I learned magic because I wanted to *amaze* others with my powers. When I was little... I was playing with my little brother in our yard, when he accidentally fell into one of those portals. I followed him into this other realm. And what I found was... a world that was simply *amazing*!\"\n  \n\"In that world, there were countless bird-looking ships cruising through the air as if it was water, there were walls with moving pictures and even inconspicuous boxes that played the most delightful music as if a band was right inside them! And somehow... the place felt *brighter* and *more vivid* in a way this world hasn't felt to me before.\"\n\n\"If there is any way to recreate those things, it has to be through magic. So as soon as I managed to make it back, that became my goal: to learn magic to make the world more *amazing*.\"": "\"我没能告诉你，但是...这些传送门真的让我着迷\"，她继续说道。\"我学习魔法是因为我想用我的力量*惊艳*他人。当我小的时候...我和我的小弟弟在我们的院子里玩耍，他不小心掉进了其中一个传送门。我跟着他进入了这个另一个领域。我发现的是...一个简直*令人惊叹*的世界！\"\n  \n\"在那个世界里，有无数看起来像鸟的船只在空中巡航，就像在水里一样，有墙壁上有移动的图片，甚至有不显眼的盒子播放着最悦耳的音乐，就像乐队就在里面一样！不知怎的...那个地方感觉*更明亮*，*更生动*，这个世界从未给过我这样的感觉。\"\n\n\"如果有任何方法能重现那些东西，那一定是通过魔法。所以一旦我设法回来，那就成了我的目标：学习魔法，让这个世界变得更*令人惊叹*。\"",
    "\"I happened to be walking through, and I heard something about some Essence Catalyst,\" he explains. \"I'm well aware just how important these are to wizards of all skill levels.\"\n      \n\"But wasn't it *difficult* to build them? Wasn't it slow, channeling all that :fireessence:? Well... *I have a solution!*\"\n\nThe merchant pulls out a book from his bag. It reads: *\"Outessenced\"*. There is a drawing of an Essence Catalyst on the cover, but next to it, there appear to be many, many other Essence Catalysts drawn, except these are only outlined. The book catches your interest. What could this possibly be about?": "\"我正好路过，听到了一些关于精华催化剂的事情\"，他解释道。\"我非常清楚这些对所有技能水平的巫师有多重要。\"\n      \n\"但建造它们不是*很难*吗？引导所有那些:火之精华:不是*很慢*吗？嗯...*我有一个解决方案！*\"\n\n商人从他的包里拿出一本书。书名是：*\"Outessenced\"*。封面上画着一个精华催化剂，但旁边似乎画着许多许多其他精华催化剂，只是这些只是轮廓。这本书引起了你的兴趣。这可能是关于什么的呢？",
    "\"I have a *hunch*: perhaps something is there that could help us\", she exclaims almost cheerfully.\n    \nYou're not sure how she could be so oblivious to the situation, but it was true that the fight pushed you to your limits...\n\n**You have unlocked two new Exploration areas: the \"Zeth Fortress\" itself where the Philosopher's Stone is at, and the \"Dragon Shrine\" at the side of its entrance!**": "\"我有一种*预感*：也许那里有什么东西能帮助我们\"，她几乎欢快地喊道。\n    \n你不确定她怎么能对情况如此视而不见，但确实那场战斗把你推到了极限...\n\n**你已经解锁了两个新的探索区域：哲人之石所在的\"泽斯堡垒\"本身，以及它入口旁边的\"龙之圣坛\"！**",
    "\"I have something just for you. This *book*,\" he exclaims, while taking something out from his backpack and showing it to you. It is, indeed, a book: the cover reads \"The Basics of Advertising\".\n  \n\"With this book, you'll be able to get much more value out of the things that you decide to sell - if you do a lot of this, it will *definitely* come in handy!\"\n\nIt sounds like a good idea, until he says: \"I'd be happy to sell it to you for *10K:coins:*. Which I'm sure you'll be able to make back in no time!\" That price feels very *steep*. You really feel like this merchant is using that very technique on you. You're not sure of whether you should buy it or not...": "\"我有样东西正好适合你。这本书*书*，\"他一边从背包里拿出东西展示给你看，一边兴奋地说道。确实，那是一本书：封面上写着\"广告基础\"。\n  \n\"有了这本书，你就能从你决定出售的物品中获得更多的价值——如果你经常这样做，它*绝对*会派上用场！\"\n\n听起来是个好主意，直到他说：\"我很乐意以*10K:coins:*的价格卖给你。我相信你很快就能赚回来！\"这个价格感觉非常*高昂*。你真的觉得这个商人正在对你使用那种技巧。你不确定是否应该买它...",
    "\"I think we could break this if we had a pickaxe\", says your wizard. \"Although it is a lot of work, I think using a strong spell to blast it would be very dangerous.\"\n      \nYou've certainly transmuted some similar things in the past. What would it take to create a sturdy enough Pickaxe? You deliberate for a while, until you come up with a solid idea. You are going to need quite a bit of silver and Earth Prisms...": "\"我想如果我们有把镐子，我们就能打破这个，\"你的巫师说。\"虽然这需要很多工作，但我觉得用强力法术炸开它会非常危险。\"\n      \n你过去确实转化过一些类似的东西。制作一把足够坚固的镐子需要什么？你思考了一会儿，直到想出了一个好主意。你将需要相当数量的银和地之棱镜...",
    "\"I will introduce myself. I am... *Lytha*, the *Doom Sorceress*. Pleased... to meet you.\" She bows deeply; almost as if mocking you.\n    \nYou get straight to the point: you ask her about the Philosopher's Stone... and you see her lips curving into a smile.": "\"我来介绍一下自己。我是...*莉莎*，*末日女巫*。很高兴...见到你。\"她深深地鞠了一躬；几乎像是在嘲笑你。\n    \n你直截了当地问她关于贤者之石的事...你看到她的嘴角弯成了微笑。",
    "\"I've been actually watching you since you started exploring, and - I've noticed the various kinds of enemies you have been fighting and items you have been finding. And I've been *recording information* about them!\" She shows you a book, titled *\"Compendium\"*.\n      \nYou admit you are a little intrigued. You walk up to her and open the book. It is barely filled in, but the few pages that have writing in them have quite a lot of information - including even *drawings* of each of the enemies you have defeated!": "\"其实自从你开始探索以来，我一直在观察你，而且——我注意到了你一直在战斗的各种敌人和你一直在找到的物品。我一直在*记录信息*关于它们！\"她向你展示了一本书，标题是*\"图鉴\"*。\n      \n你承认你有点好奇。你走向她并打开书。它几乎没有填满，但那些有文字的页面有很多信息——甚至包括你击败的每个敌人的*图画*！",
    "\"I've heard the best Wizards out there actually use *different* spells\", she begins to explain. \"Those Wizards, I think they use Spellcrafting to *strengthen* and *modify* their individual favorite spells. I think Prisms were one important reagent in this process!\"\n  \nShe appears to be struggling, though: \"But... I am not really sure how to do it...\" She looks at you, fairly determined: \"But you should *definitely* hold on to those /element/ Prisms! And we should figure out how to do it - those foes keep getting stronger and stronger!\" But she finally simply asks, out of energy again: \"Do you... um... know how we could learn how to Spellcraft...?\"\n\nYou give it a little thought.

    "\"I-I've been here ever since... trying to devise a plan to recover the Philosopher's Stone and bring the School back to normal... b-but I couldn't come up with anything,\" he exclaims.

    "\"Is someone there?\" The coarse voice comes from inside. \"Come in.\"\n    \nYour hired wizard and you hesitantly enter. On the other side of the door is a room that is fancied like a study, or a lab perhaps - shelves full of potions and substances of various colors, several books, and a large desk in the center with flasks and other glass containers. On the other side of the desk is the so-called \"Mad Alchemist\": a man in his later years, with grey curly hair, a furrowed brow, and a peculiar scent.": "\"有人在吗？\"粗糙的声音从里面传来。\"进来。\"\n    \n你和你雇佣的巫师犹豫地走了进去。门的另一边是一个装饰得像书房或实验室的房间——架子上摆满了各种颜色的药剂和物质，几本书，中央有一张大桌子，上面放着烧杯和其他玻璃容器。桌子另一边是所谓的\"疯狂炼金术士\"：一个晚年男子，灰色的卷发，皱着的眉头，和一种奇特的气味。",

    "\"You appear quite exhausted, but your new gadget looks amazing!\" He points at that last Monstium Catalyst. \"And I feel like it looks *just* like this one here... hold on...\"\n      \nHe takes off his bag, and you watch him as he browses through its contents. It is actually full of various books. He pulls one from the pile. It reads: *\"How to Scam People\"*.\n\n\"Oh, wait, it's not this one,\" he exclaims, putting it back inside. He continues to look through and finally pulls another thin tome. It looks quite similar to a book you have. This one is called: *\"Outmonstiumed\"* and has a Monstium Catalyst in the cover, together with outlines of many more.": "\"你看起来很疲惫，但你的新装置看起来棒极了！\"他指着最后一个Monstium催化剂。\"而且我觉得它看起来*就像*这里的这个...等等...\"\n      \n他取下他的包，你看着他浏览里面的内容。它实际上装满了各种书籍。他从堆中抽出一本。上面写着：*\"如何骗人\"*。\n\n\"哦，等等，不是这本，\"他惊呼道，把它放回里面。他继续翻找，最后抽出了另一本薄薄的书。它看起来和你有的书很像。这本叫做：*\"Outmonstiumed\"*，封面上有一个Monstium催化剂，还有许多轮廓。",
    "\"You have yet one more challenge to go through before you can complete the training, however\", she says. \"Each of those Towers tested your ability and affinity with a different Element. But, in actual combat against real adversaries, a Wizard will need to know the strengths and the weakness of each element, and combine them in order to craft the right strategy. It is a very important lesson.\"\n    \nThen she tells you more: \"Because of that reason, I will see how you do in battle by myself, in a duel. If you are able to hold your own against me, I will deem you worthy of having finished the training.\"": "\"然而，在你完成训练之前，你还有一个挑战要面对\"，她说。\"每座塔都测试了你对不同元素的能力和亲和力。但是，在实际对抗真实敌人的战斗中，巫师需要知道每种元素的强弱，并将它们结合起来以制定正确的策略。这是非常重要的一课。\"\n    \n然后她告诉你更多：\"因此，我将亲自在决斗中观察你的战斗表现。如果你能在我面前坚持住，我将认为你已经完成了训练。\"",
    "\"You would... *really*... ignore my condition...? Just... for your *mission*...\" Her voice is filled with rage. You shiver; you feel you cannot look at her in the eye.\n    \n\"Then... You leave me no choice...\"\n\nAnd just a second after she finishes saying that, you feel a strong pull on your hands. Distracted as you were by her, you don't realize what's going on, until it's too late: *your hired wizard has taken the Philosopher's Stone from you!*": "\"你...*真的*...会无视我的条件...？仅仅...为了你的*任务*...\"她的声音充满了愤怒。你颤抖；你觉得你无法直视她的眼睛。\n    \n\"那么...你让我别无选择...\"\n\n就在她说完这句话的一秒后，你感觉到一股强大的拉力作用在你的手上。由于你被她分散了注意力，你没有意识到发生了什么，直到为时已晚：*你雇佣的巫师已经从你那里拿走了贤者之石！*",
    "\"You're meant to put *Elements* in the grid! Then, depending on what Elements and what position you put them on, you get different *bonuses*.

    "*\"Go now. Be on your way.\"* The Divine starts moving their wings, floating in the air, and then swiftly they fly away.

Perhaps this is the key...?": "*\"现在去吧。上路吧。\"* 神明开始挥动他们的翅膀，漂浮在空中，然后迅速飞走了。你用眼睛跟随他们，但仅仅几秒钟就失去了他们的踪影。\n  \n你花了一分钟思考这种新力量，并看着神圣的卷轴。也许这就是关键...？",
    "*\"Halt there.\"* He raises his hand at you, prompting you to stop.\n  \n*\"It makes no sense for you to fight me today. Not only would you stand absolutely no chance as you are right now, but I'm not your real objective.\"*\n\nInstead, he reaches in between his armor and pulls... an *envelope*?": "*\"停下。\"* 他向你举起手，示意你停下。\n  \n*\"今天你和我战斗毫无意义。不仅以你现在的状态绝对没有胜算，而且我也不是你的真正目标。\"*\n\n相反，他从盔甲之间伸手拿出...一个*信封*？",
    "*\"NO!\"* The Divine screams. *\"How can you be protected against such a thing, if you're not a Divine...?!\" He begins to charge another beam, but you leap and strike at him before he is able to finish!\n\n*\"Ugh! I'm NOT letting you have the Philosopher's Stone!!\"* With another motion, the Divine creates a dimensional portal, and quickly steps through it... with the Philosopher's Stone.": "*\"不！\"* 神明尖叫着。*\"如果你不是神明...你怎么可能抵御这样的攻击？！\"* 他开始充能另一道光束，但在他完成之前，你跃起并击中了他！\n\n*\"呃！我不会让你得到贤者之石的！！\"* 随着另一个动作，神明创造了一个维度传送门，并迅速穿过它...带着贤者之石。",
    "*\"Stop for a second. We need to talk.\"*\n  \nThe imposing voice comes from behind you. You turn around, and you see a being fully covered in plate armor with large white wings. You can tell - this has to be another *Divine*. You grab your weapon instinctively, but the entity gestures you to put it down. You reluctantly do so, even if somewhat blinded by rage.": "*\"停一下。我们需要谈谈。\"*\n  \n威严的声音从你身后传来。你转过身，看到一个全身覆盖着板甲、拥有巨大白色翅膀的存在。你可以确定——这一定是另一个*神明*。你本能地抓住武器，但这个存在示意你放下。你不情愿地照做了，尽管被愤怒蒙蔽了双眼。",
    "*\"Today... we will not be fighting. Didn't you know...?\"*\n  \nConfused, you listen to the Divine. He continues:\n\n*\"You are attempting the Universal Challenge! Your goal was not to recover the Philosopher's Stone. It was to transcend humanity.\"*": "*\"今天...我们不会战斗。你不知道吗...？\"*\n  \n你困惑地听着神明的话。他继续说：\n\n*\"你正在尝试宇宙挑战！你的目标不是找回贤者之石。而是超越人类。\"*",
    "*\"WELCOME!\"*\n      \nThe loud sound startles you as you place one foot on the structure. The source is... a humanoid with a pumpkin head. It looks just like a Spookist, but they seem more refined - its clothing looks clean and high-class.\n\nYou ready for combat, but the pumpkin head gestures you not to worry.": "*\"欢迎！\"*\n      \n当你一只脚踏上这个结构时，响亮的声音让你吓了一跳。声音的来源是...一个有着南瓜头的人形生物。它看起来就像一个Spookist，但似乎更加精致——它的衣服看起来干净且高档。\n\n你准备战斗，但南瓜头示意你不要担心。",
    "*\"Where do YOU think you're going?\"*\n\nThe message comes from another humanoid. You realize this is the source of the spell that hit you. You take a look at it. It's a being with multiple arms - and bandages fully covering their face.": "*\"你以为你要去哪里？\"*\n\n这条信息来自另一个人形生物。你意识到这就是击中你的法术的来源。你看了看它。这是一个拥有多只手臂的生物——脸上完全覆盖着绷带。",
    "*\"YOU!\"* You hear the Divine screaming. It appears he was struck by something. Shortly after, you feel a flurry of Mind spells being flung across the room. Then you notice: *it is the Mindbender*!\n  \nBefore you have time to react, you hear a loud ripping sound. You realize the Divine has just opened a large dimensional portal! Before you can react, he crosses it, and flies away at a high speed. The portal then begins to close...": "*\"你！\"* 你听到神明尖叫着。看起来他被什么东西击中了。不久之后，你感觉到房间里有一连串的心灵法术被投掷。然后你注意到：*是心灵操纵者*！\n  \n在你来得及反应之前，你听到一声响亮的撕裂声。你意识到神明刚刚打开了一个巨大的维度传送门！在你反应之前，他穿过它，以高速飞走了。传送门随后开始关闭...",
    "*\"You dare tell us... that we just HAND OVER the Stone... to a THIEF?!\"* Its voice is very deep, loud and powerful, and just hearing it fills you with unease.\n    \n*\"Do you even know WHO you are talking to, impudent spellcaster?\"*\n\nConnecting the dots, it is obvious: from how they are dressed, and where they are... are they the King of the Zeth? The ruler of the lost Kingdom...? You shudder, as you realize this.": "*\"你竟敢告诉我们...就这样把石头...交给一个窃贼？！\"* 它的声音非常深沉、响亮且有力，光是听到就让你感到不安。\n    \n*\"你甚至知道你在跟谁说话吗，无礼的施法者？\"*\n\n串联起线索，显而易见：从他们的穿着和他们所在的地方来看...他们是泽斯之王吗？失落王国的统治者...？你颤抖着，意识到这一点。",
    "*\"You did it; out of your own strength. We have been watching\"*, they say with a strong voice. \"You have proven that you are strong enough to handle what you call the Philosopher's Stone.\"\n\nYou are a little dizzy, still in disbelief. You actually *bested a Divine in battle*...": "*\"你做到了；凭借自己的力量。我们一直在观察\"*，他们用坚定的声音说。\"你已经证明你足够强大，可以处理你所谓的贤者之石。\"\n\n你有点头晕，仍然难以置信。你实际上*在战斗中击败了一个神明*...",
    "*\"You m-must not use it!\"* The Headmaster, with a stuttery voice, interjects in the conversation. \"I-It holds a terrible power...! Y-Your kingdom was *ruined* by this Stone!\"\n\nThe humanoid, however, just laughs again. \"And what would YOU know about *our history*? *No*! It was not the Stone that ruined our kingdom. It was *its absence* that did! If it wasn't for that... *rogue*... your world would still be *ours*!\"": "*\"你绝-绝不能使用它！\"* 校长用结巴的声音插话道。\"它-它拥有可怕的力量...！你-你的王国就是被这块石头*毁灭*的！\"\n\n然而，那个人形生物只是再次笑了。\"而你对*我们的历史*了解多少？*不*！毁灭我们王国的不是石头。是它的*缺失*！如果不是因为那个...*叛徒*...你的世界仍然会是*我们的*！\"",

    ":retirement:**Retirement** is one of the most powerful features in the game. In essence, retiring allows you to restart the game from the beginning, including choosing a new primary Element. However, there are strong benefits to retirement which are detailed below.\n    \nWhen you retire, the level your primary Element is currently at is permanently recorded. This level is called the **Maximum Primary Level**, or **MPL**. The MPL for an Element can never go down - if you re-select an Element as your primary and then retire again without reaching your previous MPL, you will keep the previous value.\n\nAfter you retire, you will get a **Global Study Exp Multiplier**. This multiplier is very important, as it can vastly improve the effectiveness of studying, letting you unlock stronger spells much, much quicker.\n\nIn addition, there is a similar **Global Production Multiplier** which will affect all resource production you have from Channeling, furniture and other features in the game. This includes Mana, which means after retirement it should be much easier to cast stronger spells or cast spells more often. This also affects :coins: and :monstium: dropped in Exploration.\n\nBoth of the multipliers above are determined based on two factors. The first is the maximum MPL you have ever achieved, regardless of Element. This is the main factor impacting the two multipliers. The second is the sum of all the MPLs you have across all the Elements. This is a secondary factor and it will impact the multipliers, but not as much. Because of this, it's recommended to **pick a new Primary Element when retiring** if possible, to maximize the bonuses.\n\nOne last benefit from retirement is related to Storylines. Any **benefits acquired from Storylines will persist through retirements**, meaning progress will become faster. In addition, some Storylines only provide their benefit after you retire once - retiring is encouraged in order to get the full benefit in those cases.\n\nDeciding when to retire is very important. One suggestion is to retire if progress has gotten slower or achieving the next Goal (see: **Home** help section) appears impossible. Another is to retire if the Study exp and production multipliers will substantially increase, or if you complete a Storyline with powerful effects that only appear after retirement. For the first retirement *only*, it is usually a good idea to retire if your new Global Study Exp Multiplier will be above 2.5x (i.e. do not retire right away after unlocking Retirement).": ":retirement:**退休**是游戏中最强大的功能之一。本质上，退休允许你从头开始游戏，包括选择一个新的主要元素。然而，退休有强大的好处，详情如下。\n    \n当你退休时，你的主要元素当前所在的等级将被永久记录。这个等级被称为**最大主要等级**，或**MPL**。一个元素的MPL永远不会下降——如果你重新选择一个元素作为你的主要元素，然后再次退休而没有达到你之前的MPL，你将保留之前的值。\n\n退休后，你将获得一个**全局学习经验倍数**。这个倍数非常重要，因为它可以大大提高学习的效率，让你更快地解锁更强大的法术。\n\n此外，还有一个类似的**全局生产倍数**，它将影响你通过引导、家具和游戏中其他功能获得的所有资源生产。这包括法力，这意味着退休后施放更强大的法术或更频繁地施放法术应该会容易得多。这也影响探索中掉落的:coins:和:monstium:。\n\n上述两个倍数由两个因素决定。第一个是你曾经达到的最大MPL，不论元素。这是影响这两个倍数的主要因素。第二个是你所有元素的MPL总和。这是一个次要因素，它会影响倍数，但影响不大。因此，建议在退休时**尽可能选择一个新的主要元素**，以最大化奖励。\n\n退休的最后一个好处与故事线有关。任何**从故事线获得的好处都会在退休后保留**，这意味着进度会变得更快。此外，一些故事线只有在你退休一次后才会提供它们的好处——在这些情况下，鼓励退休以获得全部好处。\n\n决定何时退休非常重要。一个建议是，如果进度变慢或实现下一个目标（见：**家园**帮助部分）似乎不可能，就退休。另一个建议是，如果学习经验和生产倍数将大幅增加，或者如果你完成了一个故事线，该故事线具有仅在退休后出现的强大效果，就退休。对于第一次退休*仅*，如果你的新全局学习经验倍数将超过2.5倍（即不要在解锁退休后立即退休），通常是一个好主意。",

The exception to this rule are Poison effects caused by pouch items.\n* **If you apply *a different* Poison effect, it will not stack.** Instead, the effect with the highest \"potential damage\" will stay. Potential damage is calculated by multiplying the remaining duration by the magnitude of the effect. For example, if an enemy has a -10:hp:/sec effect that lasts for 10 more seconds and you apply a new -30:hp:/sec effect that lasts for 2 seconds, the enemy will keep the former since 100 (10:hp: times 10 seconds) is greater than 60 (30:hp: times 2 seconds).": "在进入下水道入口后，你可能会开始找到各种方法来施加一种叫做中毒的状态效果。\n      \n简而言之，中毒在激活时会随时间减少:hp:。这种减少忽略:防御:和:闪避:。\n\n一个目标在任何时候都不能有多个中毒效果激活：\n\n* 如果你多次施加*相同的*中毒效果（即它来自同一来源并且造成相同数量的:hp:伤害），效果的*持续时间*将会叠加。这条规则的例外是由袋装物品引起的中毒效果。\n* **如果你施加*不同的*中毒效果，它将不会叠加。** 相反，具有最高\"潜在伤害\"的效果将保留。潜在伤害是通过将剩余持续时间乘以效果的大小来计算的。例如，如果一个敌人有一个-10:hp:/秒的效果，持续10秒，而你施加一个新的-30:hp:/秒的效果，持续2秒，敌人将保留前者，因为100（10:hp:乘以10秒）大于60（30:hp:乘以2秒）。",

After you do so, you will immediately obtain a new Slime Familiar.\n\nBy expanding a Familiar in the Familiars screen, you can see a breakdown of their stats, as well as their recent activity. You can also Summon the Familiar so that it fights at your side while you Explore, or you can send the Familiar to any area you have unlocked the boss of and have them Explore it by themselves.\n\nIf you Summon the Familiar, they will fight at your side. They will attack the enemy during Exploration, and they are able to take their hits for you. There are more details in the Help item *\"Combat with Familiars\"* under the Exploration category.\n\nIf you tell the Familiar to Explore by themselves, they will do so automatically - and when they encounter an enemy, they will either immediately defeat it, netting you their loot; or they will fail, in which case they will just Explore the same area again. The higher your Familiar's level is, the higher the chance of success will become. Having a higher level Familiar explore a lower level area also reduces the amount of time they spend Exploring.\n\nYou can also tell the familiar to \"Auto-Explore\". They will essentially Explore by themselves, but they will constantly move to the highest-level unlocked area that they can safely Explore without you having to reassign them. This is usually the best choice if you are trying to obtain :monstium:, :coins: or levels.\n\nFamiliars gain Exp by either being active in combat and next to you when you defeat an enemy in Exploration, or by simply succeeding when they Explore by themselves. Typically, Exp gained while they are fighting with you is higher. In addition, when a Familiar successfully fights an enemy that is consider stronger than themselves, they will gain even more Exp. Letting Familiars fight at your side against challenging enemies is one of the best ways to increase their level.\n\nThere are also rumors of specific items that can be Transmuted, that can drastically change the appearance of a Familiar, making them stronger and shifting their combat moves...": "在:familiars:**使魔**界面，你可以查看并指挥你最好的朋友，那些能在你身边战斗甚至为你探索的生物——使魔！\n      \n要获得使魔，你需要建造一个名为*使魔箱*的家具。这个家具需要:lifeessence:生命精华。完成后，你将立即获得一个新的史莱姆使魔。\n\n通过在使魔界面展开使魔，你可以看到它们的属性分解以及最近的活动。你也可以召唤使魔，让它在探索时与你并肩作战，或者你可以将使魔送到你已经解锁了首领的任何区域，并让它们自己探索。\n\n如果你召唤使魔，它们将与你并肩作战。它们会在探索时攻击敌人，并能够为你承受攻击。探索类别下的帮助项*\"与使魔战斗\"*中有更多详细信息。\n\n如果你让使魔自己探索，它们会自动进行——当它们遇到敌人时，它们要么立即击败它，获得战利品；要么失败，在这种情况下，它们会再次探索同一区域。你的使魔等级越高，成功的几率就越大。让高等级使魔探索低等级区域也会减少它们探索所需的时间。\n\n你也可以告诉使魔“自动探索”。它们基本上会自己探索，但会不断移动到它们可以安全探索的最高等级解锁区域，而无需你重新分配。这通常是尝试获得:monstium:、:coins:或等级时的最佳选择。\n\n使魔通过在你击败探索中的敌人时在战斗中活跃并站在你旁边，或者通过自己探索成功来获得经验。通常，与你一起战斗时获得的经验更高。此外，当使魔成功击败比自己更强的敌人时，它们会获得更多经验。让使魔与你一起对抗具有挑战性的敌人是提高它们等级的最佳方法之一。\n\n还有传言说，某些可以转化的物品可以极大地改变使魔的外观，使它们变得更强大并改变它们的战斗动作...",
    "In the :rituals:**Rituals** screen, you can start or stop Rituals, strong semi-permanent bonuses that affect many aspects of the game! But, in exchange, they will corrupt you. How much :corruption:Corruption are you willing to take to further increase your power...?\n      \nRituals are unlocked based on your Death element level. That means Death needs to be unlocked to use them. The higher your Death level is, the more Rituals you will have access to.\n\nEach active Ritual gives you a fixed amount of :corruption:Corruption. You have a certain limit to how much Corruption your body can tolerate: the base limit is just 1:corruption:. If you have more :corruption: than your limit, your abilities will get crippled depending on how much higher it is:\n\n* Going slightly over the limit, you will get a penalty to your Max:hp:.\n* If you are 3:corruption: or more above the limit, you will also get a steep penalty to Element exp gain.\n* Finally, if it becomes 5:corruption: or more above the limit, you will get an extra harsh penalty to the amount of items and resources needed for Transmutation spells.\n\nActivating a Ritual will also give you a temporary debuff called *\"Ritual Weakness\"*. This severely cripples your combat abilities for a minute. Because of this, activating rituals during combat is unwise.": "在:rituals:**仪式**界面，你可以开始或停止仪式，这些强大的半永久性加成会影响游戏的许多方面！但是，作为交换，它们会腐蚀你。你愿意承受多少:corruption:腐蚀来进一步增强你的力量...？\n      \n仪式根据你的死亡元素等级解锁。这意味着需要使用死亡元素才能使用它们。你的死亡等级越高，你可以使用的仪式就越多。\n\n每个激活的仪式都会给你一定量的:corruption:腐蚀。你的身体对腐蚀的承受能力有一定的限制：基本限制仅为1:corruption:。如果你的:corruption:超过你的限制，你的能力将根据超过的程度受到削弱：\n\n* 稍微超过限制，你的最大:hp:会受到惩罚。\n* 如果你的:corruption:超过限制3或更多，你的元素经验获取也会受到严重惩罚。\n* 最后，如果超过限制5或更多，转化法术所需的物品和资源数量将受到额外的严厉惩罚。\n\n激活仪式还会给你一个临时的减益效果，称为*\"仪式虚弱\"*。这会严重削弱你的战斗能力一分钟。因此，在战斗中激活仪式是不明智的。",
    "In the :synchro:**Synchro** screen, you can arrange your fully unlocked Elements in a 3x3 grid. Adjacent Elements in the grid will give you various bonuses, depending on the Elements themselves. You can reassign Elements to the grid anytime.\n      \nYou can place each Element up to 2 times in the grid, and because of the size and shape of the grid, the maximum amount of bonuses you can have is 12. Bonuses are multiplicative with each other.\n\nSome bonus effects may show up as \"???\". If that is the case, it's because you haven't yet unlocked what the effect does. For example, if an effect would give +10% Droplet of Healing spell power, but you hadn't unlocked the spell Droplet of Healing, it would appear as \"???\". In addition, sometimes, a pair of Elements may not provide a bonus, or it might give a bonus with negative effects. Optimize your grid so that you avoid these negative effects!\n\nYou have the ability to set up 8 grids in total. However, only the active grid will provide its bonuses at any time. You can swap between grids quickly either from the Synchro screen, or from the Exploration screen, under the Strategy tab.\n\nSome grid ideas:\n\n* You can easily obtain 4 times of a single boost by creating a 2x2 square within the grid where the top-left and bottom-right are the same Element, and the top-right and bottom-left are another Element.\n* Fire+Earth is a good combination for melee builds. Water+Air is a good combination for offensive spellcasters.\n\nWhen fully unlocking Elements, they will become usable in the Synchro grid. Revisit your set-up occasionally to see what new combinations you may find!": "在:synchro:**同步**界面，你可以在3x3的网格中排列你完全解锁的元素。网格中相邻的元素会根据元素本身给你各种加成。你可以随时重新分配元素到网格中。\n      \n你可以在网格中放置每个元素最多2次，由于网格的大小和形状，你可以拥有的最大加成数量是12。加成彼此之间是相乘的。\n\n一些加成效果可能显示为“???”。如果是这种情况，那是因为你还没有解锁该效果的作用。例如，如果一个效果会给予+10%的治疗水滴法术力量，但你还没有解锁治疗水滴法术，它会显示为“???”。此外，有时，一对元素可能不提供加成，或者可能提供带有负面效果的加成。优化你的网格以避免这些负面效果！\n\n你总共有能力设置8个网格。然而，只有激活的网格会随时提供其加成。你可以从同步界面或探索界面的策略标签下快速切换网格。\n\n一些网格想法：\n\n* 通过在网格中创建一个2x2的正方形，其中左上角和右下角是相同的元素，右上角和左下角是另一个元素，你可以轻松获得4倍的单一加成。\n* 火+土是近战构建的好组合。水+风是攻击性施法者的好组合。\n\n当完全解锁元素时，它们将可以在同步网格中使用。偶尔重新审视你的设置，看看你可能会发现什么新的组合！",

Transmutation lets you transform items, elemental essences and other resources into new items.\n\nThe screen shows your possible Transmutations as a grid.

You start the game with four pouch item slots, and you can have multiples of the same item in those slots. For example, you can fill your pouch with four :cherry:Cherry.\n      \nPouch items can be used only during combat, and each one will have a certain amount of uses. Entering a new combat will refresh the pouch items and restore their uses.\n\nMost pouch items will be used automatically during combat unless you disable this behavior in the \"Items\" tab in Exploration.

Instead of draining your :mana: all at once at the time the spell is cast, your :mana: will instead be drained over time.\n      \nYou can set a spell to Perma-Cast from each individual spell's details. Not every spell is available for Perma-Cast: usually, they need to either have a cooldown or grant a buff or a debuff to be Perma-Cast eligible.\n\nPerma-Cast's ease of setup is one of its biggest advantages, and is especially good for buffs that you always want to have on, such as Enchant Mana Spouts. When a buff or debuff is caused by a spell you have on Perma-Cast, it will be displayed with a (P) on any lists of buffs or debuffs, and it will show towards the bottom of the list so that you don't need to worry about its presence.\n\nAnother, more subtle advantage of Perma-Cast is that Wizards assigned to Perma-Cast spells will pool together their :wizardpower:, so you will likely need less Wizards than if you had individual rules for all of them. Any Wizards not assigned to any other rule will be considered for Perma-Cast.\n\nIf your :mana: or :wizardpower: generation is not large enough to sustain all your Perma-Cast spells, your Wizards will first prioritize spells that could help with the problem, such as Enchant Mana Spouts. Afterwards, they will prioritize those that are \"cheaper\", so that most of the effects stay valid. However, despite this, it can still cause problems if it isn't resolved. If this is happening, your Wizards menu icon will change, letting you know that there is an unsolved issue.\n\nWhen you save or load Wizard Strategies, the Perma-Cast spell configuration is also saved. When you load a Wizard Strategy, if your :mana: or :wizardpower: is not enough to sustain all the spells, Perma-Cast spells will be disabled starting from the most expensive. You can utilize this feature to, for example, load a Strategy early in the game, get more Wizards and :mana: generation, then load the same Strategy again to cover more of its spells.\n\nThe list of Perma-Cast spells in the Wizards menu is sorted by inverse priority order.

You try very hard to bring some sense of relief to your feelings, but...\n\n\"She... *s-she didn't make it*\", the Headmaster finally exclaims, with a voice full of sadness.\n\nYou feel a very strong burst of sadness. You *refuse to believe* this is the case. You cast your strongest healing spells on her, one after the other. But after a while, you realize that nothing is happening... they are ineffective. *Your hired wizard is dead.*\n\nYou feel a sudden, strong sense of guilt. Why... did you have to fight her? You review what happened in your memory. She was very sick before the fight; it almost felt like she was already at Death's door. But you refused to use the *Philosopher's Stone* to help her, because you wanted to eradicate the disease. And then...\n\nWait. *Where* is the Stone right now? You search around your deceased companion. It seemed like it was nowhere to be found, but then... you notice a cracked rock, close to her body. It appears to be out of place. You look at it closely, and realize: *this is the Philosopher's Stone.* But the realization leads to another terrible feeling...\n\n*The Philosopher's Stone is now devoid of power.*\n\nFull of despair, you grab the Stone once more and try hard to detect magical energy within it, but to no avail. You try infusing Mana into it, but it doesn't work either. *It has become as useless as an ordinary rock.*\n\nYou fall on your knees. You almost can't believe what happened. You went through magic school and journeyed throughout the World, defeating foes more powerful than you could have imagined, together with your wizard companion and, later, the Headmaster of the School; all in order to obtain the Philosopher's Stone, in order to save the World from the terrible disease that took your close relative. But when you finally managed to obtain the Philosopher's Stone, not only did you lose it, *failing* your mission; you were also unable to save your companion from the disease. *Even if you had the opportunity to do so.*\n\n**You have made a terrible mistake.** Empty-handed, you look at your hired wizard once more. The deep sense of guilt over being unable to save her overwhelms you. You feel things couldn't have gone any worse. And, deep inside, you can't shake off the feeling that *it was all your fault.*\n\nYou will never forget this dreadful day for the rest of your life.": "那个异常强大的骷髅，连同你的巫师同伴，都比萨特尔更强。这怎么可能...？你跳跃并击中了骷髅的头部。令你惊讶的是，它似乎被击晕了！你准备再次攻击，但你注意到你雇佣的巫师的身体——以及骷髅——在颤抖，仿佛失控了。不久之后，骷髅开始消失，你的巫师同伴无力地倒在地上。你赢了吗...？\n      \n这一切是怎么回事？她从你那里偷走了贤者之石，然后...她被它附身了。但不同于你之前看到的怪异形态——畸变怪物——这次，它表现为一个外部实体...\n\n你突然回想起她在可怕战斗前的困境。你冲到她身边。*她还好吗？！*你看着她——她看起来一点都不好。校长跪在她身边，检查了她一分钟。然后，他终于看着你...\n\n他开始说话。*\"她...\"*但他突然停下来，低下头。你问他她是否还好，但他没有回答。\n\n*哦不。*你担心最坏的情况。你再次检查她。你非常努力地想要给自己带来一些安慰，但是...\n\n\"她... *她没能挺过来*\"，校长终于用充满悲伤的声音喊道。\n\n你感到一阵强烈的悲伤。你*拒绝相信*这是真的。你一个接一个地对她施放你最强的治疗法术。但过了一会儿，你意识到什么都没发生...它们都无效。*你雇佣的巫师死了。*\n\n你突然感到一种强烈的内疚感。为什么...你必须和她战斗？你在记忆中回顾发生了什么。她在战斗前病得很重；几乎感觉她已经到了死亡的门槛。但你拒绝使用*贤者之石*来帮助她，因为你想要根除这种疾病。然后...\n\n等等。*现在*石头在哪里？你在你已故的同伴周围搜索。似乎找不到它，但然后...你注意到她身体附近有一块裂开的石头。它似乎不合适。你仔细看它，意识到：*这就是贤者之石。*但这个认识带来了另一种可怕的感觉...\n\n*贤者之石现在失去了力量。*\n\n充满绝望，你再次抓住石头，努力检测其中的魔法能量，但无济于事。你尝试将魔力注入其中，但也不起作用。*它变得像普通石头一样无用。*\n\n你跪倒在地。你几乎无法相信发生了什么。你经历了魔法学校并在世界各地旅行，与你的巫师同伴以及后来的学校校长一起，击败了比你想象中更强大的敌人；所有这些都是为了获得贤者之石，为了拯救世界免受夺走你近亲的可怕疾病的侵害。但当你终于设法获得贤者之石时，不仅失去了它，*失败*了你的任务；你也无法从疾病中拯救你的同伴。*即使你有机会这样做。*\n\n**你犯了一个可怕的错误。**空手而归，你再次看着你雇佣的巫师。无法拯救她的深深内疚感淹没了你。你感觉事情不可能更糟了。而且，内心深处，你无法摆脱*这都是你的错*的感觉。\n\n你一生中永远不会忘记这个可怕的日子。",

And in front of you, displayed at the back of the room, you see *the trophy*: the real thing.

    "The clash of otherworldly strength goes on for a long time. The Ascended Headmaster switches weapons countless times, apparently trying out so many different ways to triumph, but you're able to see through their strategy each and every single time. The spectators are few, but the clash feels worthy of a public exhibition.\n    \nEventually, the combat pauses. Your enemy lowers their weapon. You look at them. Somehow, you feel a mutual understanding - you have felt their vast power, and they have felt yours. The Divine with long, green hair proclaims an end to the fighting. A victory? A draw? You are not sure, but she confirms it right after: *you've proven your strength*.\n\n\"I was unsure at first, but... there is no doubt\", she exclaims, nodding at the Ascended Headmaster. *\"Your strength matches that of a Divine. You, too, appear to have transcended humanity.\"*\n\nYour wizard companion yells out of joy: \"That was *INCREDIBLE*! I can't believe what I've just seen!\" You feel a warm satisfaction inside. The feeling of achievement.\n\nThese feelings slowly give room to deep thought. In your eyes, you've pretty much become a magical powerhouse, but these beings are saying you have *transcended humanity*... What does that mean, exactly? Are you no longer human...? You look at the Ascended Headmaster. Did you become... just like them?\n\n\"You have cleared the Universal Challenge\", says the Divine, continuing to speak. \"And as a being as strong as you are, I present to you the reward you have been seeking. *The Power to Travel through Worlds!*\" With a loud yell, she produces a strong light that flashes at you and your companions, and you feel an immense amount of Mana coursing through your body. The feeling stops in just a few seconds, but something... just *feels different*.\n\nTravel through Worlds...? You look around. You are in the \"Crossroads of Worlds\"... and all those Dimensional Portals abound. They lead to other Worlds, don't they...? Does it mean you can now *travel* through them?\n\n\"Usually, as a safeguard, most life beings cannot simply wander into other Worlds at will, Worlds that they don't belong to\", exclaims the female Divine. \"If those who are not qualified were to do so, it would bring the entire Universe into pure chaos. But - you, *and your companions*, have all shown throughout this Challenge that you have everything you need to harness and utilize this ability.\"\n\nYou keep silent and think. It feels like an immense reward, but... you're still not quite sure what you would do with it! You turn to your companions, who have also received this ability.\n\nThe Headmaster says to you, with a smile on his face: \"Countless Worlds... are a chance for even more a-adventure!\" But he glances at the Ascended Headmaster, and quickly amends his thought: \"Well... But I have *important responsibilities* to tend to, so I don't think I'd be u-using this ability right away...\"\n\nYour hired wizard has a clearer response: \"This... is the key I needed for my own goals. To find the World that inspired me to study magic, of course!\" You slightly recall her story about that intriguing, radically different World that she stumbled upon during her childhood. You watch her for a minute as she begins to look more closely at each portal around the platform.\n\nAnd as for you... You feel a little exhausted. It has been a long, long journey. You tackled an astoundingly difficult Challenge, and triumphed in the end. **You have transcended humanity.** You're thinking to go back to your home for some time and recover your energies - while you think about what exactly to do with this power to travel through Worlds.\n\n...What would *you* use it for?": "异世界力量的碰撞持续了很长时间。升天的校长无数次更换武器，显然尝试了许多不同的胜利方式，但你每次都能看穿他们的策略。观众虽少，但这场战斗感觉值得公开展示。\n    \n最终，战斗暂停了。你的敌人放下了武器。你看着他们。不知怎的，你感觉到了一种相互的理解——你已经感受到了他们巨大的力量，他们也感受到了你的。那位有着长绿发的神宣布战斗结束。胜利？平局？你不确定，但她随后确认了：*你已经证明了自己的力量*。\n\n\"我一开始还不确定，但...毫无疑问\"，她点头对升天的校长说。*\"你的力量与神相当。你，似乎也已经超越了人类。\"*\n\n你的巫师同伴高兴地喊道：\"那真是太*不可思议*了！我简直不敢相信我刚才看到的！\"你内心感到一种温暖的满足感。成就的感觉。\n\n这些感觉慢慢让位于深思。在你看来，你已经几乎成为了一个魔法强者，但这些存在说你已经*超越了人类*...这到底是什么意思？你不再是人了吗...？你看着升天的校长。你变得...和他们一样了吗？\n\n\"你已经通过了宇宙挑战\"，神继续说道。\"作为一个像你这样强大的存在，我向你呈现你一直在寻找的奖励。*穿越世界的力量！*\"随着一声大喊，她产生了一道强烈的光芒，闪烁在你和你的同伴身上，你感觉到一股巨大的魔力流过你的身体。这种感觉只持续了几秒钟，但有些东西...感觉*不同了*。\n\n穿越世界...？你环顾四周。你在\"世界的十字路口\"...到处都是那些维度门户。它们通向其他世界，不是吗...？这是否意味着你现在可以*穿越*它们了？\n\n\"通常，作为一种保护措施，大多数生物不能随意漫游到他们不属于的其他世界\"，女神解释道。\"如果那些没有资格的人这样做，将会给整个宇宙带来纯粹的混乱。但是——你，*和你的同伴*，在这个挑战中已经展示了你们拥有利用这种能力所需的一切。\"\n\n你保持沉默并思考。这感觉像是一个巨大的奖励，但...你仍然不太确定你会用它做什么！你转向你的同伴，他们也获得了这种能力。\n\n校长微笑着对你说：\"无数的世界...是更多冒险的机会！\"但他瞥了一眼升天的校长，迅速修正了他的想法：\"嗯...但我有*重要的责任*要处理，所以我不认为我会立即使用这种能力...\"\n\n你雇佣的巫师有一个更明确的回应：\"这...是我实现自己目标所需的关键。当然，是为了找到那个激励我学习魔法的世界！\"你稍微回忆起她关于那个在她童年时期偶然发现的、截然不同的世界的故事。你看着她开始更仔细地观察平台周围的每个门户。\n\n至于你...你感到有点疲惫。这是一段漫长、漫长的旅程。你应对了一个极其困难的挑战，并最终取得了胜利。**你已经超越了人类。**你想着回家一段时间，恢复你的精力——同时思考如何利用这种穿越世界的力量。\n\n...你会用它做什么？",

I wonder if higher :defense: would help us on the later forms...": "这个巨大的植物难以置信地强大。这可能是我们迄今为止最艰难的战斗。非常强大的攻击，非常强的毒。使用解毒剂（需要毒系7级）肯定也能帮助我们，因为我们可以中和它拥有的非常强的毒。但最糟糕的是，它最终会变异成更危险的形式！我想知道更高的:defense:是否会在后期形式中帮助我们...",
    "This guardian... It is literally a turtle in flames! Its attacks are extremely strong and easily pierce through any amount of defense, but they are very slow. It also has a fair amount of defense. Using effects that increase your maximum :hp: might be the best way to survive Fireball. But you will also need to have a good source of healing that you can repeat, because it does a lot of damage! A weapon with high :attack: might also be effective.": "这个守护者...它实际上是一只火焰中的乌龟！它的攻击非常强大，很容易穿透任何数量的防御，但它们非常慢。它也有相当数量的防御。使用增加你最大:hp:的效果可能是生存火球的最佳方式。但你也需要有一个可以重复的好治疗来源，因为它造成了很多伤害！一个高:attack:的武器也可能有效。",
    "This horrid but powerful spellcaster is blocking our way forward to the Philosopher's Stone! It will begin the fight with Curse - get your Familiar to take this hit, or you won't be able to heal yourself! Then, afterwards, it will use several different status effects, including Poison and Paralysis. Let's make sure to keep at least a wizard or two on Antidote. I think high :defense: may work a little better against it. If it is too difficult, let's make sure we are using Major Heal (requires Life Lv41) as best we can. Watch out for its signature move though: if it summons a Ritual Golem, eventually it'll absorb it and regain a large portion of its :hp:! But maybe if we use Curse (requires Death Lv15) before that happens, we could prevent it...?": "这个可怕但强大的施法者正在阻挡我们前进到贤者之石的道路！它会以诅咒开始战斗——让你的使魔承受这一击，否则你将无法治愈自己！然后，之后，它会使用几种不同的状态效果，包括毒和麻痹。让我们确保至少有一两个巫师在解毒剂上。我认为高:defense:可能对它稍微有效一些。如果太难，让我们确保我们尽可能好地使用大治疗（需要生命41级）。不过要小心它的标志性动作：如果它召唤了一个仪式傀儡，最终它会吸收它并恢复大量的:hp:！但也许如果我们在那之前使用诅咒（需要死亡15级），我们可以防止它...？",
    "This hulk of gems sure looks sparkly! Ah, what I wouldn't give to be able to sell these... Anyway, the spellcasting restrictions in this place are no joke. Its :defense: is very high, it auto-buffs itself with Protection from Earth, and it loves to use Knockout to stun us! Remember, our restriction on other elements is just for casting spells. So a *very* strong Fire weapon or maybe something that causes Poison might help. Or perhaps there might be something else that could bypass its :defense:? Its attacks are moderately strong, but very slow - and with our strong Earth buffs we should be taking little damage. If we find a way to stay alive, we can win!": "这个宝石巨人看起来确实闪闪发光！啊，我多么希望能卖掉这些...无论如何，这个地方的法术限制不是开玩笑的。它的:defense:非常高，它自动用土系保护自己，而且它喜欢用击倒来眩晕我们！记住，我们对其他元素的限制只是施放法术。所以一个*非常*强大的火武器或可能造成毒的东西可能会有帮助。或者可能有其他东西可以绕过它的:defense:？它的攻击中等强大，但非常慢——而且有了我们强大的土系增益，我们应该受到很少的伤害。如果我们找到一种保持生命的方法，我们就能赢！",
    "This is Satell... So *this* is their true power?! It'll use the same attacks and general strategy as its original form. But they are much, much stronger, faster, and more resilient - they will start the fight with an Energy Shield that prevents almost all damage. Besides the preparations we might have made for the weaker version, consider extra ways to mitigate their damage - if your primary element was Holy, we could use Primary Protection or even try to get the elusive Rainbow Armor (requires Holy Lv72). I'm sure we can do this!": "这是Satell...所以*这*是他们的真正力量？！它会使用与原始形态相同的攻击和一般策略。但它们更强大、更快、更有韧性——它们会以能量盾开始战斗，几乎防止所有伤害。除了我们可能为较弱版本做的准备外，考虑额外的减轻它们伤害的方法——如果你的主要元素是圣，我们可以使用主要保护，甚至尝试获得难以捉摸的彩虹盔甲（需要圣72级）。我相信我们能做到！",

It is also a rumor, but I heard this creature can regrow its heads...": "这是一个巨大、可怕、三头怪物！而且*每个*头都单独危险——但你得同时对付所有三个！不过，如果你造成足够的伤害，你就能摆脱它的一些头——这会让战斗变得更容易。小心它的咬击攻击，这些攻击特别具有破坏性！这也是一个传言，但我听说这个怪物可以重新长出它的头...",
    "This is not exactly how I imagined a living sphinx to be! It is quite a nimble creature and has some :dodge:. Overwhelmingly, it likes to use Air Blast. It is a very fast attack but it is quite weak! Increasing your :defense: to very high levels (over 200?) can help provide some survivability. Stoneskin and Earth Shield (requires Earth Lv21) can help with this, as can a Potion of Toughness. With enough :defense: I'm sure we can overcome it!": "这和我想象中的活着的狮身人面像不太一样！它是一个相当敏捷的生物，有一些:dodge:。它非常喜欢使用空气冲击。这是一个非常快速的攻击，但相当弱！将你的:defense:提高到非常高的水平（超过200？）可以帮助提供一些生存能力。石肤术和大地护盾（需要大地Lv21）可以帮助这一点，坚韧药剂也可以。有了足够的:defense:我相信我们可以克服它！",
    "This is one odd, large slime with wizardry powers. It is quite skilled with Mind magic - I don't think it's even possible to dodge its attacks! The main thing to watch out is Wide Psychic Slam. It will use it if it manages to leech your :mana:, but it will only do so if your :mana: is 6000 or higher... if we can keep our :mana: below that, it should be a much easier battle! I wonder if there's some way we could heal even with those spell restrictions...? If we find a way, we're sure to win!": "这是一个奇怪的大史莱姆，拥有巫术力量。它非常擅长心灵魔法——我认为甚至不可能躲避它的攻击！主要要小心的是广泛心灵冲击。如果它成功吸取了你的:mana:，它会使用它，但只有当你的:mana:是6000或更高时才会这样做...如果我们能把我们的:mana:保持在那个水平以下，战斗应该会容易得多！我想知道是否有一些方法可以在那些法术限制下治疗...？如果我们找到方法，我们肯定会赢！",
    "This is the leader of these elves that we've been seeing in the Lost Forest! Like others of his kin, he will protect himself from your primary Element.

At various phases in the fight, they will change their weapon, and with it, their strategy will shift a lot! Let's make sure to have, at least: one or two Potions of Revival, one or two Stunning Runes, an Amulet of Stun Protection ready to be equipped, and the Anti-Crit Ritual active. Dispelling Salves can also come in handy, and both the Time Dilation and Knockout spells should be extra useful. Let's watch out for these deadly attacks: Nova (very powerful!), Big Bang (extremely powerful, guaranteed instant defeat!), Titan (extremely powerful buff! Stun this one, or cast Petrification right after they use it!). The Thunder Whip will stun very often which can be very dangerous - make sure you are protected against stunning when they equip it!": "这是...学校的校长，*实际上*赢得了魔法锦标赛的人...我想不出比他们更强的对手了...！在战斗的不同阶段，他们会改变他们的武器，随之他们的策略也会发生很大变化！让我们确保至少拥有：一两个复活药剂，一两个眩晕符文，一个准备装备的眩晕保护护身符，以及激活的反暴击仪式。驱散药膏也可能派上用场，时间膨胀和击倒法术应该特别有用。让我们小心这些致命的攻击：新星（非常强大！），大爆炸（极其强大，保证即时失败！），泰坦（极其强大的增益！眩晕这个，或者在它使用后立即施放石化术！）。雷霆鞭会经常眩晕，这可能非常危险——当它装备时，确保你受到眩晕保护！",
    "This might have used to be a Sewer Fish, but something odd has happened to it! It is strong. It will use Water attacks that also hit itself.

It also has powerful healing abilities, and will liberally heal itself for large amounts of :hp:. But the most dangerous spell has to be its ability to Shapeshift into a powerful Dinosaur! This boosts its damage immensely. Let's try to prevent it by using Knockout (requires Earth Lv28). But if it goes through, increasing our :dodge: or lowering its :accuracy:, or even slowing it down with Absolute (requires Water Lv33) could end up saving our life...": "这个施法的鳄鱼是一个不容小觑的力量。谁能想到呢？这个施法者专攻水，会尝试用强大的法术减慢我们的速度。它还有强大的治疗能力，会自由地为自己治疗大量的:hp:。但最危险的法术必须是它变形为强大的恐龙的能力！这极大地提升了它的伤害。让我们尝试通过使用击倒（需要大地Lv28）来防止它。但如果它成功了，增加我们的:dodge:或降低它的:accuracy:，甚至用绝对（需要水Lv33）减慢它的速度，最终可能会救我们的命...",

In the end we need to defeat it before it launches a Nova on us somehow. We can do it!": "这个高大的身影似乎是天文台的负责人。除了它的最大:hp:，它的属性相当低，但它会定期使用新星——这个法术几乎保证能一击击败我们！:dodge:在这里可能有些帮助，但眩晕新星攻击也非常有效。最终我们需要在它对我们发动新星之前以某种方式击败它。我们可以做到！",
    "This three-headed Needler is bigger than the others we have seen! It is also tougher: it has much more :hp: and some more :attack:. But if we do similarly to the other one, maybe we can win?

    "Turning the corner in the Pyramid's vast corridors, you find a curious panel in one of its walls, stretching from floor to ceiling. Detailed decorations with a faint light blue glow adorn its hinges, creating a harmonious attraction towards this unusual sector of the wall.\n\nSensing your interest, your hired wizard stops right in front of it and examines it together with you.

You identify them as places where elemental prisms should be inserted.\n\nWhat could this be?": "在金字塔广阔的走廊中拐过弯，你发现墙上有一块从地板延伸到天花板的奇特面板。铰链上装饰着淡蓝色光芒的精细装饰，营造出一种和谐的魅力，吸引你走向这面墙的不寻常区域。\n\n察觉到你的兴趣，你雇佣的巫师停在它面前，和你一起检查。五个隔间围绕中心的一个圆形点排列成五边形，每个隔间都装饰着五种元素之一的符号：火、土、水、空气和毒。你认出这些是应该插入元素棱镜的地方。\n\n这会是什么呢？",

    "Whew - not only did you manage to find me, but also, you were able to defeat all my *overpowered* tricks! Congratulations!\n    \nThis ending is not part of the story of the game. Instead, it is a special, hidden ending meant only for those who have gone above and beyond in their playthrough of Magic Research 2.\n\nA few months after I finished the development of Magic Research - the \"prequel\" to Magic Research 2, and the first commercial game I released - I realized it was much more successful than I originally thought it would be. It was strongly inspirational, and pushed me to spend even more of my time in the game, slowly improving it more and more. But one thing was difficult: adding *more content* to the game. It was mainly difficult because the game felt *complete*, and by the time you finished it, you were so powerful and able to break almost every mechanic that it was hard to add on any new content.\n\nInstead, I decided to focus many of the new ideas into a small prototype, of a similar game. A better way to automatically cast spells. More significance and variety to Element choice. The ability to get more powerful simply by \"leveling up\". The removal of the tedium of crafting consumable items. More clarity on Storyline unlock conditions, and less dependence on randomness. More variety in items and spells, with large amounts of synergies. And, of course - wrapping all of that with a new story.\n\nOf course, the prototype grew and grew. Soon enough, I found it was fun - just as fun as Magic Research. That meant one thing: this prototype stood a chance at being another good game!\n\nFrom that point onwards, I kept improving it. I went through the game three times (or more!) as I balanced it, over and over, removing as many annoyances as I could. I caught myself hooked into the challenges of my own ideation, trying to figure out what was the best way to solve them. And eventually... it became Magic Research 2. What you see now, and what you have just played through.\n\nBuilding Magic Research 2 was fun, without a doubt. But it would be a lie if I said it was the same as making my first game, Magic Research. This time, it was much more difficult - there was a very high bar to meet, set by the previous release. The pressure of making an entirely new game that is just as good - or better - loomed over me as I developed it. In the end... I found myself playing this game countless hours out of pleasure, so I feel I might have succeeded.\n\nYou have made it all the way here. I'm hoping your journey through the game was just as enjoyable as mine was.\n\nOnce more - congratulations, and enjoy your secret Storyline!\n\n-@Maticolotto": "哇 - 你不仅设法找到了我，而且还能够击败我所有的*超强*技巧！恭喜你！\n    \n这个结局不是游戏故事的一部分。相反，它是一个特别的、隐藏的结局，只为那些在《魔法研究2》的游戏中超越自我的人准备的。\n\n几个月前，当我完成了《魔法研究》 - 《魔法研究2》的\"前传\"，也是我发布的第一款商业游戏 - 的开发时，我意识到它比我最初想象的要成功得多。它非常鼓舞人心，推动我花更多的时间在游戏中，慢慢地改进它。但有一件事很难：向游戏添加*更多内容*。这主要是因为游戏感觉*完整*，当你完成它时，你已经非常强大，几乎可以打破每一个机制，以至于很难添加任何新内容。\n\n相反，我决定将许多新想法集中到一个类似游戏的小原型中。一个更好的自动施法方式。元素选择的重要性和多样性。通过\"升级\"变得更强大的能力。消除制作消耗品的繁琐。故事线解锁条件的更清晰，减少对随机性的依赖。物品和法术的更多多样性，有大量的协同作用。当然 - 用一个新的故事包裹所有这些。\n\n当然，原型不断增长。很快，我发现它很有趣 - 就像《魔法研究》一样有趣。这意味着一点：这个原型有机会成为另一款好游戏！\n\n从那时起，我不断改进它。我玩了三次（或更多！）游戏，因为我平衡了它，一遍又一遍，尽可能多地消除烦恼。我发现自己沉迷于自己构思的挑战中，试图找出解决它们的最佳方法。最终...它变成了《魔法研究2》。你现在看到的，以及你刚刚玩过的。\n\n毫无疑问，构建《魔法研究2》很有趣。但如果我说它和我制作的第一款游戏《魔法研究》一样，那是在撒谎。这一次，它要困难得多 - 有一个非常高的标准要满足，由之前的发布设定。制作一个全新游戏的压力，这个游戏同样好 - 或更好 - 在我开发它时笼罩着我。最后...我发现自己出于乐趣玩了无数次这个游戏，所以我觉得我可能成功了。\n\n你已经走到了这里。我希望你在游戏中的旅程和我的一样愉快。\n\n再次 - 恭喜你，享受你的秘密故事线！\n\n-@Maticolotto",

    "Your decision made, you spare no time and get to work right away. You close your eyes. With great focus, you direct the unbelievably strong healing energy from the Philosopher's Stone into the ailing body of your hired wizard companion. Attuned to its power, you feel the stream of Mana coursing through her body, reaching as deep as each of her fingertips.\n    \nEven with all that power, it almost feels like it's not enough. You continue directing the Mana towards her, draining even more power from the Stone. You feel the Philosopher's Stone beginning to crack under the intense exertion you are applying to it, but you don't stop. You *can't* stop: she doesn't deserve to die here.\n\nWith a last burst, you fetch the last bits of power from the Philosopher's Stone. The burst of energy is even stronger than before. Your body shakes and trembles from its power, but you stay calm, and channel it straight into her body. Exhausted of energy, the torrent from the Philosopher's Stone finally slows down. Did it work...? You are filled with anxiety, unsure of the results...\n\nYou open your eyes. In front of you, you see the Headmaster, with a frown on his face; leaning in front of your wizard companion. The hired wizard's laying down on the ground. You look down and see her, and...\n\nImmediately, you feel a *sense of relief*. Her skin color is back to normal, and she is no longer shaking. She appears to be resting peacefully, her breaths calm and controlled. You let yourself take a deep breath and relax. *It appears to have worked!*\n\nThe Headmaster speaks to you, in a serious tone. \"Thank you... thank you for *making the correct decision.*\" This time, you notice no stutter in his words. \"She appears to be fine now... she only needs a little rest. This... was definitely the best outcome.\"\n\nYou hear a soft cracking sound. You look down at your hands, at its source. You are still holding the Philosopher's Stone, but it looks quite different now. Its glow is gone, and you notice it has split into two separate pieces. It is now *just a normal rock*. With some sadness, you put the pieces down on the ground.\n\n\"I know your motivation, and I am aware just how difficult it was to decide... to decide to abandon your mission when you were so close\", says the Headmaster. \"The Philosopher's Stone is no more... but I truly believe that is for the best. After seeing what happened at the School... after seeing how deeply the Zeth were corrupted by this object... I don't think Satell's words were entirely unreasonable.\"\n\nYou look down once more at your wizard companion. Crouching next to her, you think about your original motivation. To save the entire World from that deadly disease... the same that took your dear relative. You crossed deserts, caverns, and a forest; you climbed a mountain, and even ventured into entirely foreign realms *twice*. You became a lot stronger through your journey, defeated otherworldly beings you never knew existed, and you ultimately succeeded at finding what you were looking for: the Philosopher's Stone. But in the end... all you managed to do with it was to *save a single life*. The life of your hired wizard.\n\nYour thoughts are interrupted by a weak moan. *Your wizard companion is waking up!*\n\nWith a slow, careful movement, she looks around. She first sees the Headmaster. His frown turns into a soft smile; you have never seen him express this emotion before. And then, she looks at you. And she speaks.\n\n\"You... saved me, didn't you...? ...Even if... even if it meant everyone else would not be...\" Then she closes her eyes, pauses for a while, and continues: \"I am so grateful... and relieved... words cannot express my gratitude. *Thank you.*\"\n\n**Your journey has finally come to an end.** In this distant realm, on those moonlit plains, you retrieved the Philosopher's Stone, and you used it to save a life. Your mission was a *failure*: the Philosopher's Stone is gone now, and you couldn't achieve your goal of eliminating the deadly disease that took your close relative from the World. But, despite this failure, you obtained something else, something you had never even thought of before: the unbreakable bonds you forged with your adventuring partners.\n\nAnd together, you begin the trip back... and a new journey, to face whatever the future might hold.": "你做出了决定，毫不拖延地立即开始工作。你闭上眼睛。以极大的专注力，你将来自贤者之石的难以置信的强大治愈能量引导到你雇佣的巫师同伴的病体中。适应其力量，你感觉到魔力流经她的身体，深入到她的每个指尖。\n    \n即使有如此强大的力量，也几乎感觉不够。你继续将魔力引导向她，从贤者之石中汲取更多的力量。你感觉到贤者之石在你施加的强烈压力下开始裂开，但你没有停止。你*不能*停止：她不应该死在这里。\n\n随着最后的爆发，你从贤者之石中汲取了最后的力量。这股能量爆发比之前更加强大。你的身体因它的力量而颤抖，但你保持冷静，并直接将其引导到她的身体中。能量耗尽，贤者之石的洪流终于减缓。它起作用了吗...？你充满了焦虑，不确定结果...\n\n你睁开眼睛。在你面前，你看到校长，皱着眉头；靠在你雇佣的巫师同伴面前。雇佣的巫师躺在地上。你低头看她，然后...\n\n立刻，你感到*一种解脱感*。她的肤色恢复正常，不再颤抖。她似乎在平静地休息，呼吸平静而控制。你让自己深呼吸并放松。*看起来起作用了！*\n\n校长以严肃的语气对你说。“谢谢...谢谢你*做出了正确的决定。*”这一次，你注意到他的话语中没有结巴。“她现在看起来很好...她只需要一点休息。这...绝对是最好的结果。”\n\n你听到轻微的裂开声。你低头看向你的手，寻找声音的来源。你仍然握着贤者之石，但它现在看起来大不相同。它的光芒消失了，你注意到它已经分裂成两块。它现在*只是一块普通的石头*。带着一些悲伤，你把碎片放在地上。\n\n“我知道你的动机，我也知道决定...决定在你如此接近时放弃你的任务是多么困难”，校长说。“贤者之石不再存在...但我真的相信这是最好的。在看到学校发生的事情之后...在看到泽斯被这个物体深深腐蚀之后...我不认为萨特尔的话完全没有道理。”\n\n你再次低头看向你的巫师同伴。蹲在她旁边，你思考你最初的动机。为了从那种致命疾病中拯救整个世界...那种疾病夺走了你亲爱的亲人。你穿越了沙漠、洞穴和森林；你爬上了山，甚至两次冒险进入了完全陌生的领域。你在旅途中变得更强大了，击败了你从未知道存在的异界生物，你最终成功找到了你一直在寻找的东西：贤者之石。但最终...你用它所做的只是*拯救了一条生命*。你雇佣的巫师的生命。\n\n你的思绪被一声微弱的呻吟打断。*你的巫师同伴正在醒来！*\n\n她缓慢而小心地环顾四周。她首先看到了校长。他的皱眉变成了温柔的微笑；你以前从未见过他表达这种情感。然后，她看向你。她说话了。\n\n“你...救了我，对吗...？...即使...即使这意味着其他人不会...”然后她闭上眼睛，停顿了一会儿，继续说道：“我非常感激...并且松了一口气...言语无法表达我的感激之情。*谢谢你。*”\n\n**你的旅程终于结束了。**在这个遥远的领域，在那月光照耀的平原上，你找到了贤者之石，并用它拯救了一条生命。你的任务*失败了*：贤者之石现在消失了，你无法实现消除那种夺走你亲密亲人的致命疾病的目标。但是，尽管这次失败，你获得了其他东西，一些你以前从未想过的东西：你与你的冒险伙伴们建立的坚不可摧的纽带。\n\n然后，你们一起开始了回程...以及一个新的旅程，去面对未来可能带来的任何挑战。",

What will you find?\n      \n:exploration:**Exploration** is a key feature of the game and easily the most complex. When you explore, you will find enemies that you will need to engage in combat with (and defeat).

You will explore for a short period of time, and then you will engage in combat against an enemy. In combat, both you and your enemy attack automatically, dealing damage to each other until a combatant's :hp:HP drops to zero. When that happens, the combatant is defeated.\n\nIf you are victorious, you will immediately start exploring again. If, instead, you are defeated, you will first wait for your :hp: to be fully recovered before exploring again. **There is no penalty for losing in combat, except for the time it takes to heal back to full.**": "你追求贤者之石的旅程将带你穿越许多危险的地方。你会发现什么？\n      \n:exploration:**探索**是游戏的一个关键特性，也是最复杂的。当你探索时，你会遇到需要与之战斗（并击败）的敌人。在一个区域击败足够多的敌人将让你与该区域的boss战斗。*挑战越来越难的boss并击败它们是《魔法研究2》中取得进展的主要方式。*\n\n首先，你需要选择一个区域进行探索。一开始，你只会解锁一个区域，但随着游戏的进展，更多区域会出现。\n\n选择区域后，屏幕会变化。你将探索一段时间，然后与敌人进行战斗。在战斗中，你和敌人都会自动攻击，互相造成伤害，直到一方的:hp:HP降至零。当这种情况发生时，战斗者被击败。\n\n如果你胜利了，你将立即再次开始探索。如果相反，你被击败了，你将首先等待你的:hp:完全恢复后再开始探索。**在战斗中失败没有惩罚，除了需要时间恢复到满血。**",
